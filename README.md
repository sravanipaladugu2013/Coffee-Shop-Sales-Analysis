Coffee Shop Sales

OverView

I analyzed sales performance for a coffee shop by examining product categories, top-performing items, and customer preferences across different time periods. To present these insights, I built interactive Excel dashboards using pivot tables and filters, enabling clear visualization of operational metrics. The analysis highlighted best-selling products and peak traffic times, leading to actionable strategies that helped boost both sales volume and customer spending.
